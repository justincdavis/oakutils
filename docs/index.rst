Welcome to oakutils's Documentation
===================================

**oakutils** is an easy-to-use and robust library for interacting 
easily with OAK cameras and the DepthAI API. It aims to bridge the gap 
between DepthAI API and SDK allow with building in integration 
with OpenCV and Open3D.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. Major API changes could occur between releases, but stability is expected when
   using version 1.4.0 or higher.
